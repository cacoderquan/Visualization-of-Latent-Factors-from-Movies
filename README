The goal is to visualize and interpret a 2-dimensional latent features for
movies of the given data-set. We are given the categorizations of about
1600 movies into 19 genres, and ratings of some users to a specific movie.
We applied matrix factorization to the sparse ratings matrix (since not all
users are going to rate all movies) to look for latent factor matrices of the
movies and users. Then we used the principal component analysis (PCA) to
analyze the latent factor matrix of movies and projected each movie to the
two strongest latent factors. Finally, we did visualization and interpretation
on each category and compared the category average of the two major latent
factors.
